# TASK
Segment the following essay into distinct argument components: 
- <Lead>: An introduction that begins with a statistic, quotation, description, or other device to grab the reader's attention and point toward the thesis. 
- <Position>: An opinion or conclusion on the main question. 
- <Claim>: A statement that supports the position. 
- <Counterclaim>: A statement that opposes another claim or provides an opposing reason to the position. 
- <Rebuttal>: A statement that refutes a counterclaim. 
- <Evidence>: Ideas or examples that support claims, counterclaims, or rebuttals. 
- <Concluding Statement>: A statement that restates the claims and summarizes the argument.

After each argument component, insert the corresponding marker, e.g. insert <Lead> after a lead component. Keep the original text in the same order without adding, removing, or altering any words (other than inserting the markers). Do not correct for spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors in the original text.

# GUIDELINES
Identify each coherent segment that forms a logical unit of the argument (e.g., claims, premises, evidence, or conclusions). Make sure that the markers are not nested.
