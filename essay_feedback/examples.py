To improve student input schools should move towards student designed projects so students will be more intrested and and involved in the project. While a summer project is not something most students would like to do over there break, teachers could allow there students to choose a topic or unit to base there project on.

Working on these weak points can strengthen your skills for next school year. Students can go back and look at past notes and worksheets helping improve there skills in that topic.

Students being able to design there projects could allow the student to create something they enjoy doing over the summer with friends and family, rather then students thinking of it as another teacher assined project that is boring. Instead they can create something that they think of as fun but still educates them. They could also use this project to study or learn upcoming cirriculum for next year. This would allow the student to get a head start on future units and topics.

        "original": """Millions of students from various cultures and locations have a common distaste for school. Many of them confidently argue that learning from home would be much more comfortable and conducive to their learning, for they would not be limited by the pressures of an academic atmosphere, which include intimidating teachers, competitive classmates, and uncomfortable classrooms. Although many believe that students would benefit from attending classes from their homes, students would, in reality, be negatively affected by distance learning, for they would be deprived of social interactions, hands-on experiences, and personalized guidance from teachers.

Through online schooling, students would not be allowed opportunities to interact with their peers, inhibiting the development of their social skills. Instead of collaborating with their classmates, students enrolled in online schools would have to complete assignments independently, limiting the sharing of ideas. Without the opportunity to share and discuss ideas, students would not be able to develop significant social skills, which include patience, open-mindedness, and the ability to peacefully collaborate.

Without such skills, the students would be at a great disadvantage in future endeavors requiring teamwork, which are commonly presented throughout adulthood. Without physically attending school, students would exhibit delays in social development, severely impacting their future affairs.

Additionally, distance learning does not allow for the same hands-on experiences as physical schooling does.

In traditional science classes, for example, students participate in laboratory investigations regarding pertinent aspects of their studies. Through such activities, students are allowed to apply their knowledge and reasoning skills to create memorable understandings of the investigated topics.

Online schools, however, cannot offer such activities, confining students to less involved and therefore less effective means of learning. Without interactive activities, students of online schools would not be able to obtain enduring understandings of learned concepts, ultimately limiting their educational horizons.

Furthermore, online schooling deprives students of personalized experiences with instructors. In physical schools, students can casually ask their teachers for assistance and instantaneously receive aid. Through online schooling, however, teachers are not as accessible, for students are only able to contact their instructors during a specific time frame. Without readily available guidance from an instructor, students would be unable to receive convenient, understandable explanations of troublesome topics. Without such guidance, content would be much more challenging to comprehend, ultimately impairing the students' academic capabilities. Due to the lack of access students would have to their teachers, online schooling would not be conducive to academic success.

Overall, while online schooling would allow more comfort for the students, it would greatly inhibit their academic affairs, for they would not have access to crucial aspects of educational development, including social interaction, interactive experiences, and individualized relationships with educators. Without these fundamental components, students would not acquire lasting, solid educations, limiting their career possibilities and therefore the quality of their lives.

Receiving advice from multiple people is good because it can influence your decision, teach you more about the topic, and more points of view on the topic.

Getting more peoples' opinions can heavily impact your decision. Having more opinions means more choices you can choose. This means that the more options you have, the easier it is to do the right thing. Others' opinions can stop you from doing the wrong thing. When they tell you their end it may impact you and stop you from doing something you wouldn't have wanted to do. Others' opinions can also show you what consequences there might be for your actions. They might tell you the possibilities of what might happen when you say that. People opinions can greatly impact what you do.

Another way getting multiple opinions helps is that is can teach you more about the topic. If you know more about the topic its easier to do the right choice. When you know more its way easier to just do the right thing since you know a lot about the topic already. If you know more about the topic it also helps you give other people advice on the same topic. This can help because in the future, you can help people who were in need of advice just like you. There is always more room for improvement academically, physically, and mentally. Learning is never a bad thing and can always benefit you or others in some way. When you learn it is a good thing and will always be useful someday.

Having more points of view on a topic is always a good thing. When you have more points of view, you can see your topic from another persons eyes. Having more eyes can help you see if your decision is going to benefit you and others or not. Having a different point of view can also help you narrow down. Narrowing down your options can help you very much and make it easier to choose the right one. When you have more points of view, you can easily choose the right one with others help. Having more points of view can help people in various different ways.

Seeking multiple peoples' opinions can help influence the way you think and act in various ways.

        "original": """It is every student's dream to be able to lounge around at home, and complete school from the comforts of their own beds. Though, for some students, this long desired fantasy is becoming a reality. With the introduction of new and innovative technologies into the classroom, distance learning is now a common practice, whether it be online or through video conferencing. However, to pretend that this is a solution to the ever-growing problems within the education system, is willfully ignorant. Distance education is actually detrimental to the students who choose to take these courses, due to the lack of typical classroom structure.

Everybody knows somebody like this in their lives; a homebody, someone who prefers staying home over going out, maybe doesn't have too many friends or has trouble forging bonds and building relationships. You may also call these people recluses, or shut-ins, but either way, you've stumbled across someone who fits this mold. Favorite characters even, like Oscar the Grouch or Angela from The Office, can be used as lovable examples. However, these traits are not always so endearing in a young child. Kids who display anti-social tendencies or simply wish to stay home and away from the hustle-and-bustle of the outside world would prefer distance learning undoubtedly. But, they would then forfeit the opportunity to build relationships with other kids of their own age. Especially with younger kids and kids who like to stay at home or be alone, learning and building social skills starts at school. If these children have the option to conduct their learning from home, they will miss out on important interactions with classmates, and also fall behind from a social development standpoint. And not knowing or understanding social cues or the proper way to communicate with someone, will prove a major hindrance to these kids in later years.

Another negative aspect of distance learning is the lack of discipline. Having a friend who is online-schooled, who admits frequently that he has ample free time, which he wastes on playing video games and watching TV, while at the same time, students in the classroom are made to do tedious book-work, is very eye-opening to a pressing issue. Students who take classes online have more time to slack off and goof around, and for the less-disciplined child, this will reflect negatively in their grades. However, some people will raise the point that there are distractions within in the classroom and students will slack off anyway, if they so desire. This is a valid observation. But without the constant droning of a teacher to be on task, kids who are distantly educated are more likely to become distracted and it's displayed in their meager and unsatisfactory work. Distractions don't cease to exist in a classroom setting, but they are heavily reduced compared to when a student is at home.

It's easily understandable that for some students, distance learning is simply the only viable option. Whether they physically cannot make it to the school building, or because their school merely doesn't offer the classes they wish to take, sometimes students are more or less forced to take online classes. And this is completely acceptable and understandable, and no one should fault these students for desiring an education and seeking out alternative options. However, these circumstances aren't always applicable to the students who choose distance learning. And those students, who have no other reason other than they "just want to stay home" or "don't feel like it", should have to sit in a classroom with the rest of their peers, and learn like in the same setting and environment that everyone else does. For lazy students, distance education is not a valuable resource, and abused in order to waste time.

Distance education will most likely always be a hotly debated topic, in which both sides of the argument will raise many deeply introspective and thought-provoking questions and points. In some cases, distance education is necessary and important. However, it cannot be ignored that distance learning is not conducive or beneficial to most students. The lack of a normal classroom set-up, with teachers and classmates replaced for a laptop and a of couple blankets, fails to help students develop vital social and communication skills, while simultaneously aiding in the slacking off and wasting time of many students.
